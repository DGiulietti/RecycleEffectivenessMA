    "As confirmed by cross validation in part 3b, the best fit models for the baseline data were all tree-based so I will only consider tree-based models for my individual clusters. Of the baseline models, the best fit was with an **bagging algorithm optimized by gridsearch parameters** (`bagging_op`). The score was 0.139. The follow up score was for an optimized random forest regressor (`rfr_op`, 0.110), and I couldn't get the boosting algorithm to work well with my dataset (I think this algorithm requires more data than most). I expect that bagging or random forest will still work best in the clusters, but I think the fits will be much better (at least in the larger clusters). It will also be interesting to see how the feature importances change."

Label 0 has the most by far, so shouldn't have too much trouble in terms of training the data and still having enough data to test. Labels 2 and 1 will become a little more challenging as they have under 100 municipalites (label 1 in particular will be tough with only 35 labels). Label 3 is Boston, all by itself, so there is no regression to be had. Boston is very much on a scale far different than any other municipality in terms of population, economic stability, etc, so this makes sense. \n",

    "So, default Bagging actually performed the best with an test score R2 value of 0.203 and an MAE of 0.054. Seems like any alterations to the bagging algorithm just resulted in worse fits both in training and testing, which I find interesting. For random forest, I was able to bring up the test score from 0.113 to 0.146 but this still doesn't beat the plain bagging algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this score still beats the overall population's fit but my hypothesis is that this rather large cluster of 150+ municipalities may actually be better represented in two groups. Perhaps going back to a clustering algorithm where n=5 may be interesting to look at in contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is further supported by the top feature importances of this bagging model which mostly mirror the total-population: indirectly population with `Households Served by Municipal Recycling Program` and funding information in `Tip Fee as of 1/1/2020`, `What is the transfer station access fee?`, `PAYT/ SMART`, and `What is the annual fee?`."

    "Okay, so it looks like it had a hard time accurately predicting lower scoring municipalities, and for some reason there's a huge jump betweeb the second to highest point and the highest point. That is rather curious... but it seems like the model at least predicted the trend, which is what we're interested in for determing important features.\n",

    "Based on the coefficients, We still see a trend of funding and population being important but we have some more diversity in features: `Maximum # bags/ barrels per week` and `SS Recycling`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These coefficients may suggest that putting a limit on how much trash you can throw out per week and that having single stream recycle services is the most effective way to increase recycling. Also, in-terms of funding models, a Pay-As-You throw (PAY/SMART) model in addition to annual fees seem to yield better rates of recycling. `Tip Fee as of 1/1/2020` implies #TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "As for total households served, I'm guessing that smaller municipalities do not have the funds to support added features like enforcement. However, enforcement doesn't seem to be a very important feature, so I'm not sure what to make of recycle rate being tied to population."
