But there are 55 features so jumping straight into a heat map may not be super helpful. Instead, I'll make a matrix of the correlations for different subcategories found in the original survey. These subcategories often had a \"primary question\" and then bunch of follow up questions if the survery-answerer marked yes to the primary question. This is leading to a lot of highly correlated features. After assessing each subcategory, I'll look at the full matrix of remaining features. I will apply a style to these matrices to identify any correlations above 0.75. "

However, I would need something like this for the baseline regression... okay, I'll keep one, let's go with `Households Served by Municipal Recycling Program` since this whole analysis is about recycling. Maybe I'll run two regressions, with and without this feature, just to see how it does.\n",

However, a lot of the time, if a municipality as a big trash can, they have a big recycling can and vice versa. I supposed what I could do is keep the `Recycle Bin Size Ranking` as is, since this is a recycling study, but make a new feature--like a manually engineered polynomial in a way--of the ratio of `recycle bin rank:trash bin rank` and I can see how that faires in the correlation matrix.\n",
