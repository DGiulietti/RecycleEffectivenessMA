    "* **Descriptive**: describe set of data\n",
    "   * The first kind of data analysis performed\n",
    "   * Commonly applied to census data\n",
    "   * The description and interpretation are different steps\n",
    "   * Descriptions can usually not be generalized without additional statistical modeling\n",
    "* **Exploratory**: find relationships you didn't know about\n",
    "   * Exploratory models are good for discovering new connections\n",
    "   * They are also useful for defining future studies\n",
    "   * Exploratory analyses are usually not the final say\n",
    "   * Exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing/predicting\n",
    "   * Correlation does not imply causation\n",
    "* **Inferential**: use a relatively small sample of data to say something about the population\n",
    "   * Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models\n",
    "   * Inference involves estimating both the *quantity* you care about and your *uncertainty* about your estimate\n",
    "   * Inference depends heavily on both the population and the sampling scheme\n",
    "* **Predictive**: use the data on some objects to predict values of another object\n",
    "   * If X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y\n",
    "   * Accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables\n",
    "   * Although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and a simple model works really well\n",
    "   * Prediction is very hard, especially about the future references\n",
    "* **Causal**: to find out what happens to one variable when another changes\n",
    "   * Usually randomized studies are required to identify causation\n",
    "   * There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions\n",
    "   * Causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual\n",
    "   * Causal models are usually the \"gold standard\" for data analysis\n",
    "* **Mechanistic**: Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects.\n",
    "   * Incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations\n",
    "   * Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations (physical/engineering science)\n",
    "   * Generally the random component of the data is measurement error\n",
    "   * If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis"
